Opinionated Rails Forum
=======================

This is a rails-based forum engine with some strong opinions:

  - Authentication is OpenID
  - There are no forums/subforums
  - Topics are tagged, and some tags are protected (can only be set by administrators)
  - Tags are lowercase. By definition
  - Everyone can edit tags for a topic
  - A user is either normal or admin, no moderators
  - Admins can split posts into a new topic
  - Avatars are gravatars
